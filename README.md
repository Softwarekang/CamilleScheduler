# CamilleScheduler

## Introduction

CamilleScheduler is a task scheduling engine designed for the era of cloud-native computing. The project's primary focus is on task scheduling, workflow orchestration (DAG), and task node pools. Task node pools can be based on various runtime environments such as Kubernetes (k8s), Docker, virtual machines, and more.

## Key Features

1. **Task Scheduling**: CamilleScheduler offers robust task scheduling capabilities. It intelligently schedules tasks based on factors such as task priority and resource requirements.

2. **Workflow Orchestration (DAG)**: CamilleScheduler supports complex workflow orchestration. Users can define dependencies between tasks using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

3. **Task Node Pools**: The task node pools in CamilleScheduler can be based on various runtime environments like Kubernetes (k8s), Docker, virtual machines, etc., offering excellent scalability.
